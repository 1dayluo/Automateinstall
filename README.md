## About

If you use markdown to record tools which recommand from the internet, you can use this shell  to auto install your tools(based on some rules)......

the default rules is:

- `##` : Identify the Topic of tool, this will create directory and use secondary title as directory name
- `###` :Identify the tools which belong to the topic,One topic has multi tools,and bash will read github's link and clone it to the "topic's directory"  as output

you can also make the rule by youself....(to-do)
